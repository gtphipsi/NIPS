# Scripts

These scripts were created to make development of the NIPS website easier. They function as various utility scripts that primarily interface
with the backing database in MongoDB.

To run the scripts, make sure to use Python 3. In addition, you'll need to **go to your Python 3 folder and double click "Install Certificates.command".**
